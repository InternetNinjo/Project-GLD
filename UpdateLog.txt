V4.50

Added achievement support & you don't need steam API key to use it!
Added pop-up notification & sound on achievement completion (both customizable!)
Made achievements progress bar & up to 4 achievements show on user profiles
Added TorBox support, it really came in clutch after RD stopped supporting piracy. We highly recommend it if you're interested in using debrids!
Added a "install" button which appears if you add a game to the library without specifying the .exe location
Fixed font inconsistency and issues
Made it so only one instance of GLD can be open at a time to prevent annoying bugs & chromium opening
Added a "syncing account data" window on exit to prevent account bugs related to reopening GLD before it finished sync
Improved the design of checkboxes
Fixed browser related issues & crashes

(gld may freeze while auto updating and its normal!!!)
(gld pode congelar ao se auto atualizar, isso Ã© normal!!!)
